# FinTech Wallet Top-Up Analytics: Customer Behavior, Cohort Insights, LTV & Revenue Forecasting

A Python-powered analysis of real digital wallet transaction data from **Duitku**, an Indonesian payment gateway.

---

## Project Summary

This project analyzes real transaction-level data from a digital wallet system to understand:

- How users fund their accounts
- How customer value evolves over time
- How monthly revenue can be forecasted

Using Python, the analysis covers:

- Behavioral insights
- Cohort dynamics
- Customer lifetime value (LTV) modeling
- Time-series revenue forecasting

The goal is to support real-world FinTech decision-making with data-driven insights.

## Data Dictionary

| Column                      | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `id`                        | Internal unique ID for this transaction record. Primary key in the transaction table. |
| `customer_id`               | Internal unique identifier for the user performing the top-up. Used for LTV, cohort analysis, and user segmentation. |
| `phone_number`              | Phone number associated with the wallet account. Often used as a secondary identity or login credential. |
| `reference_number`          | Unique transaction identifier generated by the payment processor. |
| `partner_reference_number`  | If the transaction involves external partners (banks, payment gateways), this is the ID assigned by the partner system for reconciliation and cross-checking. |
| `capture_number`            | Internal capture ID for confirming the transaction’s authorization. Payment gateways use “capture” to confirm movement of funds. |
| `receipt_number`            | Receipt number shown to the customer. |
| `note`                      | User-entered or system-generated note attached to the transaction. Often empty in automated top-up flows. |
| `detail`                    | Additional metadata about the transaction (e.g., channel info, top-up details). Can contain JSON or textual descriptions depending on the platform. |
| `currency`                  | Currency code used for the top-up (e.g., `IDR`, `USD`). In this dataset, all transactions are in `IDR`. |
| `net_amount`                | Actual top-up value credited to the user’s wallet. This is the total money the user intended to add and is the main input for revenue forecasting. |
| `fee_internal_amount`       | The platform’s internal fee per transaction. This is revenue for the FinTech company and is used in LTV calculations. |
| `fee_external_amount`       | Fees paid to external partners (banks, payment processors). This reduces the FinTech’s net revenue. |
| `type`                      | Describes the transaction type. In this dataset, all rows represent top-ups, so `type` is the same for all records: `'TOP_UP'`. |
| `journal_type`              | Accounting classification used for ledger entries. In this top-up dataset, every transaction is recorded as adding `'CREDIT'` to the user’s account. |
| `category`                  | Bank or payment category used for top-up. In the dataset, there are only three: `BRI`, `BNI`, and `Mandiri` (top-up via bank channel). |
| `status`                    | Status code for the transaction. In this dataset, everything is `'00'`, meaning a successful transaction. |
| `paying_at`                 | Timestamp when the user completed the payment. Primary timestamp for time-series and cohort analysis. Used to generate helper columns such as `year_month`, `cohort_month`, forecasting features, and daily/weekly trends. |
| `channel`                   | Top-up channel used. In this dataset, it is `DUITKU` (a real Indonesian payment gateway; “my money” in English). |
| `channel_reference_number`  | Reference number assigned by the payment channel (e.g., Duitku). Used to verify the transaction with the gateway. |
| `is_verified`               | Indicates whether the transaction has been verified by the payment channel/system. |
| `created_at`                | Timestamp when the transaction record was created in the system. Usually close to `paying_at` but not always identical. Useful for debugging delays and pipeline issues. |
| `updated_at`                | Timestamp when the record was last updated (e.g., status changes, notes added, reconciliation completed). |
| `created_by`                | User or system process that inserted the transaction. Typically `SYSTEM` or a background worker. |
